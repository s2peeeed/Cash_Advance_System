# History Feature Documentation

## Overview
The History feature displays all completed cash advance liquidations. When an administrator clicks the "Done" button in the pending.php page, the liquidation is marked as completed and automatically appears in the history.

## How It Works

### 1. From Pending to History
- In `pending.php`, each pending liquidation has a "Done" button
- When clicked, it updates the `granted_cash_advances` table:
  - Sets `status` to 'completed'
  - Sets `date_completed` to the current date (liquidation date)
- The completed liquidation automatically appears in the history

### 2. History Display
- `history.php` and `history_content.php` display all completed liquidations
- Shows statistics including total amount and count
- Displays detailed information including duration (days from granted to completed)
- Includes search functionality
- Shows monthly statistics

## Database Schema

### Main Table: `granted_cash_advances`

```sql
CREATE TABLE `granted_cash_advances` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `purpose` text NOT NULL,
  `amount` decimal(10,2) NOT NULL,
  `type` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `status` enum('pending','liquidated','overdue','completed') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  `date_granted` date NOT NULL,
  `due_date` date NOT NULL,
  `date_completed` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `idx_status` (`status`),
  KEY `idx_date_completed` (`date_completed`),
  KEY `idx_date_granted` (`date_granted`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_ci;
```

### Status Values
- `pending`: Initial status when cash advance is granted
- `liquidated`: Legacy status (being phased out)
- `overdue`: When due date has passed
- `completed`: When liquidation is finished (new standard)

### Key Columns
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Employee name
- `email`: Employee email
- `purpose`: Purpose of cash advance
- `amount`: Cash advance amount
- `type`: Type of cash advance (payroll, travel, special_purposes, confidential_funds)
- `status`: Current status of the liquidation
- `date_granted`: When cash advance was granted
- `due_date`: When liquidation is due
- `date_completed`: When liquidation was completed (set by "Done" button - this is the liquidation date)
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp

## Files Involved

### Core Files
1. **`pending.php`** - Contains the "Done" button functionality
2. **`history.php`** - Main history page with full features
3. **`history_content.php`** - Content component for history display
4. **`update_database_schema.sql`** - Database migration script

### Key Functions

#### In pending.php:
```php
// Handle liquidation completion
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['complete_liquidation'])) {
    $liquidation_id = $_POST['liquidation_id'];
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    
    try {
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE granted_cash_advances SET status = 'completed', date_completed = CURDATE() WHERE id = ?");
        if ($stmt->execute([$liquidation_id])) {
            $liquidation_completed = true;
            $completed_name = $name;
        }
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        $error = "Database error: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
}
```

#### In history.php:
```php
// Fetch completed liquidations
$query = "SELECT * FROM granted_cash_advances WHERE status = 'completed'";
if ($search) {
    $query .= " AND (name LIKE :search OR purpose LIKE :search OR type LIKE :search)";
}
$query .= " ORDER BY date_completed DESC";
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
Execute the migration script to update your database:
```sql
-- Run the contents of update_database_schema.sql
```

### 2. Verify Files
Ensure all files are in place:
- `pending.php` (already exists)
- `history.php` (already exists)
- `history_content.php` (updated)
- `update_database_schema.sql` (new)

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Go to pending.php
2. Click "Done" on any pending liquidation
3. Go to history.php to see the completed liquidation
